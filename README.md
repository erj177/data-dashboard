# Data Dashboard

A basic dashboard written in javascript, that charts and provides downloadable datasets for the price and trading volume of any stock, FX pair, or Crypto pair. I did this to demonstrate basic ability in JS (including JQuery, AJAX, and asynchronous functions), since I haven't shown these skills in a previous paid job.
